# Power BI Energy Consumption Trend Analysis Dashboard

This repository contains an interactive Power BI dashboard developed to analyze and visualize energy consumption patterns across various buildings and cities. The purpose of this project is to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions that enhance energy efficiency and reduce operational costs.

## 📊 Project Overview

The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of energy usage data, including:

- **City-wise and Building-wise Energy Consumption**
- **Cost Analysis and High-Expense Areas**
- **Energy Usage Trends Over Time**
- **Filter Options for Custom Views and Comparative Analysis**

## 🎯 Objective

To analyze large-scale energy consumption data in order to:
- Identify high-cost areas
- Uncover patterns in energy usage
- Assist in creating actionable strategies for cost reduction
- Promote sustainable energy practices

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI**: For data modeling and interactive visualizations
- **DAX**: Used for calculated columns and measures
- **Data Visualization**: Charts, filters, KPIs, and slicers for better insights

## ✅ Insights & Outcomes

The analysis provided valuable insights into energy usage patterns across different cities and building types. By using interactive dashboards, stakeholders can easily spot high-cost areas and explore specific metrics through filters and slicers. This empowers decision-makers to implement strategies that reduce energy costs and promote sustainability across operations.
